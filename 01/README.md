# n-Queens Problem

## Description

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n chess queens on an n×n chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

The eight queens puzzle is a special case of the more general n queens problem of placing n non-attacking queens on an n×n chessboard. Solutions exist for all natural numbers n with the exception of n = 2 and n = 3.

## Problem

Given an n x n chess board, find the number of possible solutions for the n queens problem for natural numbers > 3.
