# Algoholics-Anonymous
Algoholics anonymous is an initiative to bring together motivated builders, hackers and tinkerers to further the spirit of problem solving and innovation in Hong Kong. We organize weekly meetups in Hong Kong where we compete in teams to solve problems or create new products using code or any other means possible. If you like solving problems, then you'll like our events. Join our Discord server at https://discord.gg/sPagd7rM9a
